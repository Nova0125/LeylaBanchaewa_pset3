# Restaurant menu in Android Studio

This android app allows the user to scroll through a menu, select one of the menu categories and add items to the order.

This app illustrates how to implement a listview with JSONObject/Array requests.

## Features

A few things this app has built in:

* Start new activity through intent.
* Access to internet, use of JSONObject/Array requests.
* Rotation of user interface support.
* Back navigation to the startscreen.

There is no data preservation upon rotation.
